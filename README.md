Introduction

In an increasingly interconnected and digital-first world, legacy timekeeping systems such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) reveal critical shortcomings. Leap seconds, local time zone differences, and Daylight Saving Time (DST) all introduce complexities and inconsistencies that make pure UTC unwieldy for many high-precision or global applications. Meanwhile, epoch-based systems lack human readability and can be incon- venient outside of purely computational use.
Metaverse Cyber Time (MCT) is designed to resolve these issues by uniting:
•	A continuous, leap-second-free epoch counter for unbroken linear time.
•	A human-readable date (ISO 8601 style).
•	A 24-hour clock time aligned to UTC minus 6 hours (UTC-6) and never subject to DST.

The Core Structure of MCT

MCT is represented by an “MCT Stamp,” which integrates three elements:
1.	Time Element (HH:MM:SS) – Fixed to UTC-6, with atomic-clock precision, but no DST.
2.	Date Element (YYYY-MM-DD) – Also fixed to UTC-6, fully aligned with UTC leap-year and leap-second standards.
3.	Counter Element – A continuous count of seconds since June 1, 1992 (00:00 UTC), ignoring leap seconds entirely.

Why UTC-6?

MCT uses a universal offset of UTC-6 to maintain a fixed global reference point without DST fluctuations. This ensures that anyone using MCT references the exact same clock time for scheduling - there is no confusion about changing offsets in different seasons or regions.
